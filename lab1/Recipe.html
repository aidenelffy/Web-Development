        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Set the oven to 190C, gas 5.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Tip the butter into a bowl and beat it until softened. Then add the sugar, flour, salt, eggs, and milk and whisk until the mixture is smooth.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Use a traditional-style ice-cream scoop, or spoon, to divide the mixture between all the paper cases.<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Place both muffin tins in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then swap over the position of the tins over and bake for a further 3-7 minutes, until both trays of cupcakes are a light golden colour.<br>
         <strong>Step 5:</strong> Remove the tins from the oven. Leave the cupcakes to cool in the tins for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool.<br>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a very large bowl, whisk together the olive oil and garlic. Let sit for half an hour.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Make the toasted croutons: While the oil is sitting, make the croutons. Spread the baguette slices out over a baking sheet (may need to do in batches), lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat.

Brush or spray with olive oil (or melted butter, or if you want garlicky croutons, dip pastry brush in the garlic infused oil you have sitting in step 1).

Broil for a couple of minutes until the tops are lightly browned. (Note: do not walk away, these can easily go from browned to burnt.) Remove and let cool.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Make the dressing: Add anchovies and eggs to the oil garlic mixture. Whisk until creamy. Add salt and pepper and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Whisk in half of the Parmesan cheese. Taste, add more lemon juice to taste. The lemon should give an edge to the dressing, but not overwhelm it.<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Tear off chunks of romaine lettuce: Using your hands, tear off chunks of lettuce from the heads of romaine lettuce (do not use a knife to cut). Add to the oil mixture and toss until coated. Add the rest of the Parmesan cheese, toss.<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Coarsely chop the toasted bread and add (with the crumbs from the chopping) to the salad. Toss. Serve immediately.<br>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.<br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.<br>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.<br>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong> Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.<br>
        <strong>Step 9:</strong> Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.<br>
        <strong>Step 10:</strong> Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.<br>
        <strong>Step 11:</strong> Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.<br>
        <strong>Step 12:</strong> Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.<br>
