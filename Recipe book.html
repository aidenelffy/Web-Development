Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.<br>\n        <strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.<br>\n        <strong>Step 4:<\/strong> Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).<br>\n        <strong>Step 5:<\/strong> Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.<br>\n        <strong>Step 6:<\/strong> While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.<br>\n        <strong>Step 7:<\/strong> Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.<br>\n        <strong>Step 8:<\/strong> Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.<br>\n        <strong>Step 9:<\/strong> Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.<br>\n        <strong>Step 10:<\/strong> Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.<br>\n        <strong>Step 11:<\/strong> Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.<br>\n        <strong>Step 12:<\/strong> Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.<br>\n        \n<\/p>\n        \n    <p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/ultimate-spaghetti-carbonara-recipe\">ultimate-spaghetti-carbonara-recipe<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n    <\/body>\n<\/html>\n","configVersion":3,"created":"2021-02-05T15:43:04Z","editorType":"ace_webpage","folds":[],"hasAudio":false,"id":5973716950794240,"kaid":"kaid_276732734129044687650337","kind":"ScratchpadRevision","mp3Url":null,"playback":null,"tests":null,"translatedMp3Url":null,"translatedMp3Urls":null,"userKey":"ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXIrCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiHWthaWRfMjc2NzMyNzM0MTI5MDQ0Njg3NjUwMzM3DA","youtubeId":null},"rootScratchpadKey":"ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXIeCxIHUHJvamVjdCIReDZmNGNiZDAwZmI1ZTIwZTAM","searchKind":"Program","sendToPeers":false,"slug":"spin-off-of-project-recipe-book","sortIndex":-1,"spinoffCount":0,"sumVotesIncremented":1,"tags":[],"tests":"","thumbnailUrls":{},"title":"Spin-off of \"Project: Recipe book\"","topicIds":["x45aed616","x93850788","x7441c73b","xffde7c31"],"topicUrlPath":"/computer-programming","translatedDescription":"","translatedNextSteps":null,"translatedProjectEval":null,"translatedProjectEvalTips":null,"translatedTitle":"Spin-off of \"Project: Recipe book\"","trustedRevision":null,"type":"scratchpad","uniqueEnough":true,"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-recipe-book/6475191560912896","userAuthoredContentType":"webpage","userId":"kaid_276732734129044687650337","userKey":"ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXIrCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiHWthaWRfMjc2NzMyNzM0MTI5MDQ0Njg3NjUwMzM3DA","userStatus":10,"userVisibleDeleted":null,"userVisibleFlaggedBy":null,"userVisibleRevision":{"code":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Project: Recipe book<\/title>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <style>\n        h1 {\n            background-color:black;\n            color:white;\n        }\n        h2 {\n            color:rgb(89, 1, 89);\n        }\n        .meal {\n            color:rgb(18, 24, 199);\n        }\n        #cupcake {\n            color:rgb(153, 100, 153);\n        }\n        #spaghetti {\n            color:rgb(153, 100, 153);\n        }\n        #caesar {\n            color:rgb(153, 100, 153);\n        }\n        <\/style>\n    <\/head>\n    <body>\n       \n        <h1>Aidana's Recipe Book<\/h1>\n        \n        <h2>Contents:<\/h2>\n        \n        <ol>\n            <li class=\"meal\"><a href=\"#cupcake\">Cupcake<\/a><\/li>\n            <li class=\"meal\"><a href=\"#caesar\">Caesar salad<\/a><\/li>\n            <li class=\"meal\"><a href=\"#spaghetti\">Spaghetti carbonara<\/a><\/li>\n        <\/ol>\n        \n        <h2 id=\"cupcake\">Cupcake<\/h2>\n        \n        <ul>\n            <li>Time: 40 minutes<\/li>\n            <li>Serves: 24<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n        <!-- This is my recipe table -->\n        <table>\n            <thead>\n                <tr>\n                    <th>Ingredients<\/th>\n                    <th>Quantity<\/th>\n                <\/tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>unsalted butter<\/td>\n                    <td>250 g<\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>caster sugar<\/td>\n                    <td>250 g<\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>flour<\/td>\n                    <td>250 g<\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>eggs<\/td>\n                    <td>4<\/td>\n                <\/tr><tr>\n                    <td>milk<\/td>\n                    <td>4 tablespoons<\/td>\n                <\/tr><tr>\n                    <td>salt<\/td>\n                    <td>pinch<\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n            <\/thead>\n            <tbody>\n            <\/tbody>\n        <\/table>\n        \n        <p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Set the oven to 190C, gas 5.<br>\n        <strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Tip the butter into a bowl and beat it until softened.

Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.<br>\n        <strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.<br>\n        <strong>Step 4:<\/strong> Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).<br>\n        <strong>Step 5:<\/strong> Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.<br>\n        <strong>Step 6:<\/strong> While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.<br>\n        <strong>Step 7:<\/strong> Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.<br>\n        <strong>Step 8:<\/strong> Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.<br>\n        <strong>Step 9:<\/strong> Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.<br>\n        <strong>Step 10:<\/strong> Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.<br>\n        <strong>Step 11:<\/strong> Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.<br>\n        <strong>Step 12:<\/strong> Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.<br>\n        \n<\/p>\n        \n    <p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/ultimate-spaghetti-carbonara-recipe\">ultimate-spaghetti-carbonara-recipe<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n    <\/body>\n<\/html>\n","configVersion":3,"created":"2021-02-05T15:43:04Z","editorType":"ace_webpage","folds":[],"hasAudio":false,"id":5973716950794240,"mp3Url":null,"playback":null,"tests":null,"translatedMp3Url":null,"youtubeId":null},"userVisibleTrustedRevision":null,"width":400,"youtubeId":null},"topic":{"authorKey":"ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXJaCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiTHVzZXJfaWRfa2V5X2h0dHA6Ly9ub3VzZXJpZC5raGFuYWNhZGVteS5vcmcvNGFkNTZkNzFhYjlmOGM2ZjIzZmJjMGI1YzIxNDNiZWIM","backgroundImageCaption":"","backgroundImageUrl":"","backupTimestamp":"2013-09-06T16:25:14Z","brandingImageUrl":"","childData":[{"id":"x05187c3c","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"x7441c73b","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"xcffdaa1f","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"x89af0e82","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"xc9115e5d","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"xb254f8dc","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"x7d10e7ab","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"x076d758b321a30f5","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"xf409033d","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"x5e3717e0","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"xf9c6be8d","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"x76ccd5a5","kind":"Topic"},{"id":"x3dea311d","kind":"Topic"}],"conceptTags":[],"contentId":"xffde7c31","contentKind":"Topic","creationDate":"2020-12-11T18:05:21Z","curation":{"blacklist":["Topic:xf409033d","Topic:x5e3717e0","Topic:xf9c6be8d","Topic:x76ccd5a5","Topic:x3dea311d","Topic:xde9be2087fa2350c"],"hideRecommended":true,"modules":[{"actions":[{"contentDescriptor":"Topic:xffde7c31","text":"New JavaScript Program","url":"/computer-programming/new/pjs"},{"contentDescriptor":"Topic:xffde7c31","text":"New webpage","url":"/computer-programming/new/webpage"},{"contentDescriptor":"Topic:xffde7c31","text":"New SQL Script","url":"/computer-programming/new/sql"}],"kind":"ActionList","title":"Create a new program"},{"callToAction":"Meet the professionals","description":"Meet a professional - everyone from mobile health app developers to product managers to physics programmers.
